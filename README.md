# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends
**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
For this project, I implemented and fine-tuned a Deep Q-learning model for maze navigation. I also developed and tested the TreasureHuntGame.ipynb notebook to visualize training progress, and modified exploration and reward parameters to help improve learning performance. 

**What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
The base maze notebook environment and Q-learning framework were provided in Codio. I expanded on this by modifying the training parameter, implementing a decay schedule, and adding early stop logic once the agent reached its goal before running the maximum number of epochs. This required a reward system to help motivate the agent's performance and help reduce training time. 

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**
 This project helped me connect reinforcement learning concepts to the larger field of computer science by showing how systems can learn from data and experience rather than explicit instructions. Reinforcement learning applies algorithms, logic, and statistical reasoning to model human-like decision-making. These principles drive real-world technologies such as autonomous vehicles, recommendation engines, and adaptive robotics that learn and improve over time without being manually reprogrammed.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists design and develop systems that solve problems through logic, data, and algorithms. In this project, reinforcement learning simulated how a computer can learn from its environment, which mirrors human trial-and-error learning. This type of work drives innovation in fields such as healthcare, automation, and artificial intelligence, where reliable, efficient, and ethical computation is essential to improving real-world outcomes.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
I like to approach problems systematically, starting by analyzing requirements, modeling data, implementing algorithms, testing iteratively, and refining based on performance. Reinforcement learning emphasizes experimentation to help adjust hyperparameters and evaluate results to reach optimal outcomes.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
As a CS, I have an obligation to ensure that intelligent systems behave fairly, safely, and transparently. This includes preventing bias in machine learning models, protecting user data, and ensuring that AI systems are used responsibly. Designing ethical AI is critical to maintain trust and prevent unintended harm in real-world applications.
